    <h3>Toast's Touch</h3>
    
    <p>A simple portfolio page quickly developed and uploaded for the simple sake, at least at this point in time, to present this amazing portrait captured by one of my children.</p>
    <p>And also to wish Chloe a Happy Birthday, if she happens to take a look at this website!</p>

    <p>Maybe some day later I will create a real portfolio website for professional purposes.</p>
